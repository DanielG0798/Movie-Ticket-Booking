## Reporting a Vulnerability

Thank you for helping to keep the **Movie Ticket Booking** project secure!

If you find a security vulnerability, we ask that you follow the process below to ensure that the issue is addressed in the safest manner possible.

### Please do not create a public issue on GitHub for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please follow the steps below to report vulnerabilities:

1. **Send an email**:  
   Please send an email at:  
   `danielg0798@gmail.com` 

2. **Include detailed information**:  
   Provide as much information as possible in your report, including:
   - A description of the vulnerability and how it can be exploited.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability (if applicable).
   - The potential impact of the vulnerability.
   - Affected versions or components of the software.
   - Any relevant code snippets, configurations, or logs (without exposing sensitive data).

3. **We will verify and triage your report**:  
   Once we receive your report, we will prioritize it based on the severity and impact. We will acknowledge the issue and work towards a resolution as quickly as possible.

4. **Public Disclosure**:  
   After we've resolved the vulnerability, we will release a patch and then disclose the issue publicly, crediting the person who reported it (if they wish to be credited). We will provide details on how the issue was fixed and advise users to update their version of the project.

### Security Best Practices

- **Keep your dependencies up to date**:  
  Regularly update your libraries and tools to mitigate known vulnerabilities. Check for security updates for the libraries you use in the **Movie Ticket Booking** app.

- **Use strong authentication and encryption**:  
  Ensure that any sensitive data, such as user information or payment details, is stored securely with appropriate encryption and protection.

- **Monitor for suspicious activity**:  
  Keep an eye on logs and monitor for any unusual activity that could indicate a security breach.

## Vulnerability Disclosure Process

1. **Report**: When a vulnerability is identified, send an email to `danielg0798@gmail.com`.
2. **Assessment**: Our security team will assess the issue's severity and possible impact.
3. **Fix**: Once the fix is ready, we will deploy it as quickly as possible and notify affected users.
